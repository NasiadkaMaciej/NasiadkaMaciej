# Hello, I'm Maciej Nasiadka ðŸ‘‹

Hi! I am Maciej Nasiadka, a software developer and Linux enthusiast. I create tools that optimize workflows and allow me to polish my skills. I enjoy the process of problem-solving and building solutions from scratch. Specializing in C++ development, I also work confidently with multiple programming languages. My extensive daily experience with Linux has given me comprehensive knowledge of system architecture and capabilities.

Feel free to take a look at my projects on GitHub. I've also uploaded some of the scripts I made on [gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com/NasiadkaMaciej/)
